# Course Project for Getting and Cleaning Data

The script "run_analysis.R" read data files from the downloaded txt files and stores the data as data.frame. 

Activity labels (1 to 6) were converted to actual discription of the activities. Columns were labeled accordingly based on description of the dataset.
